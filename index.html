                <h3>Project 1 Title</h3>
                <p>In my role as a fresher frontend Developer ,I undertook
                    the creation of a simple yet efficient web -based
                    calculator project. Leveraging HTML for structure, CSS for
                    styling, and JavaScript for functionality, I meticulously
                    crafted a user- friendly interface that allows seamless
                    arithmetic operation.
                    The proposed system has to be examined for its
                    technical, economical and operational feasibility. It is
                    evaluated from developer and user's point of view.
                    Feasibility study includes consideration of all the possible
                    way to provide a solution to the given problem. The
                    proposed solution should satisfy all the user requirements
                    and should be flexible enough so that the future changes
                    can be easily done based on the future upcoming
                    requirements.
